          This is the main gallery where the player can explore the many art
          pieces on the wall, and has 3D models inspired by M.C. Eschers work.
          Each display has clear text for easy readability as well as an option
          for audio tours for accessibility (triggered by the buttons on the
          left of the screenshot).

          A creative feature that I added to the project was to allow the user
          to enter each of the art pieces and explore a virtual world depicting
          the art pieces. This is one of the worlds that the user can enter to
          become immersed.

          The overall projects aim was to explore the fake news and conspiracy
          theory about the HAARP facility; this is supposedly an US government
          funded facility that can control the weather for weaponised or other
          political purposes. The project explores the conspiracy that HAARP
          intentionally triggered the natural disasters such as the 2005
          Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. This has been
          implemented into the virtual world by visualising these events in
          multiple scenes based on each disaster and having the player trigger
          them. The overall aim is to question the user, asking whether they
          feel it is even possible to control the weather, and if so, why would
          such drastic disasters be caused on purpose.

          These are the weather controllers that the user can interact with in

          the disaster.

        <h2 class="show-text">DRONE ARENA</h2>
        <p class="show-text">
          The main purpose of this program was to be able to simulate drones
          moving around an arena with obstacles. The colours, images and layout
          chosen in the GUI have been effective in doing this: with
          distinguishable images chosen the user can easily identify what
          objects in the arena do what, and with a easy to use layout of button
          controls the user can easily alter the arena in any way they please.
          The GUI is user friendly in this aspect and due to the quality of the
          written code things such as errors and crashes are not likely to
          occur, improving robustness of the program.

        <h2 class="show-text">OOP DESIGN</h2>
        <p class="show-text">
          The design process of this program has gone well. The use of
          appropriate models and tests were used effectively to identify and
          implement required methods and classes as well as test for any issues.
          By first laying out the program in a model, the actual implementation
          and programming was made easier which is something that will continue
          to be done in future projects.<br />
          <br />
          Object (abstract class): Object is an abstract class in the drone
          simulation which will define the X and Y position of the objects in
          the arena as well as its radius (size). All objects will need to be
          drawn to the canvas, checked and adjusted.<br />
          <br />
          Drone: The drone class defines the behaviour of a normal type drone in
          the simulation. It uses the concept of inheritance to get the passed
          down information from the abstract class but will also include the
          droneâ€™s angle and speed to define how it will move through the arena.
          This drone will be represented by an image of a drone. It will need to
          be drawn, checked and adjusted. Saving will save the information
          generated in the toString<br />
          <br />
          Obstacle: This class also inherits information from the Object
          abstract class but will remain stationary in the simulation so it will
          not need any methods defining its movement. This will be represented
          by an image of a house in the simulation that the drones will avoid.
          It will need to be drawn, checked and adjusted. Saving will save the
          information generated in the toString.<br />
          <br />
          Sensor Drone: This class is very similar to the Drone class but will
          have altered values to make sure it has a better ability to detect and
          avoid obstacles and other drones, it will also be represented by a
          slightly altered image than the drone class (such as a different
          colour). It will need to be drawn, checked and adjusted. Polymorphism
          is used as the way this class is checked will be different. Saving
          will save the information generated in the toString.
        </p>

        <h2 class="show-text">DRONE CLASS</h2>
        <p class="show-text">
          DroneArena: This is where the objects will be added into an array with
          random positions and random speeds and angles for the drones. It will
          also see if any of the objects are hitting each other or if they are
          hitting the border and will adjust their movement angle accordingly.
          All information of the objects will be stored in a string that can be
          saved. <br />
          <br />
          MyCanvas: The canvas is where the arena will be drawn into and how the
          information of all the objects will be displayed to the user.<br />
          <br />
          DroneInterface: This class will be where the interactive buttons are
          created and defined as well as how the canvas will be shown to the
          user. This class will also handle all of the animations.

          Wizard is the character controlled by the users and the different
          bandits would be the enemies throughout the levels and finally a boss
          would appear. <br /><br />The boss and the wizard will both be able to
          attack (getAttack()) and will both have death animations (getDead()).
          <br /><br />All characters will have a health, speed, position and
          size and can all move and will have a hitbox. <br /><br />The normal
          bandits will only move towards the user however, and the bandit2 will
          be stronger than bandit1. <br /><br />The canvas is needed to draw all
          of the other classes.
